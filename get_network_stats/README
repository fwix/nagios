These are used for gathering and graphing network information
for a linux based system.

It is assumed that you have a working nagios installation with pnp4nagios.

Quick overview of what to do:

1) copy get_network_stats.py to the various host machines to be monitored
2) add the appropriate nagios command and service definition, making
sure that the paths are setup correctly.
3) copy the template file into your pnp4nagios share/templates directory
4) reload nagios

Example nagios definition:

define command {
  command_name  get_network_stats
  command_line  /usr/bin/ssh $HOSTADDRESS$ python $USER3$/get_network_stats.py -i $ARG1$
}

define service {
  use                   noncritical-service
  hostgroup_name        linux-servers
  service_description   STATS-network_io
  check_command         get_network_stats!eth0,bond0
}
